## K8S Cluster
- Deployment Platforms

- Master Nodes: responsible for maintaining the desired state for your cluster (using etcd)
    - kube-apiserver: the front end for the Kubernetes control plane to exposes the Kubernetes API.
    - etcd: Consistent and highly-available key value store used as Kubernetesâ€™ backing store for all cluster data
    - kube-scheduler: watches newly created pods that have no node assigned, and selects a node for them to run on.
    - kube-controller-manager: runs controllers ((may in one process)
         - Node Controller: Responsible for noticing and responding when nodes go down.
         - Replication Controller: Responsible for maintaining the correct number of pods for every replication controller object in the system.
         - Endpoints Controller: Populates the Endpoints object (that is, joins Services & Pods).
         - Service Account & Token Controllers: Create default accounts and API access tokens for new namespaces.
    - cloud-controller-manager: runs controllers that interact with the underlying cloud providers.
    
- Working Nodes: the machines (VMs, physical servers, etc) that run the applications and cloud workflows
    - kubelet, which communicates with the Kubernetes Master.
    - kube-proxy, a network proxy which reflects Kubernetes networking services on each node.
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/): CLI to communicate with api-server in Master Nodes using [K8S API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/api-index/)

## K8S Objects
Basic Objects
- Pod
- Service
- Volume
- Namespace

 Higher-level abstractions rely on Controllers to build upon the basic objects:
- Deployment
- DaemonSet
- StatefulSet
- ReplicaSet
- Job and CronJob
- Service
- Load Balance
- Networking (DNS, Registry)
