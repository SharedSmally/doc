- [ Super pom.xml ](https://maven.apache.org/ref/3.6.3/maven-model-builder/super-pom.html)

## Concepts

- Goal 

The single unit of task which does some real work. For example the compile goal (runs as  mvn compiler:compile) compiles the Java source. 
All goals are provided by plugins, either by default plugins or by user defined plugins (configured in pom file).

- Phase

A group of ordered goals. Zero or more plugin goals are bound to a phase (either by default or by user). 
For example the compile phase (runs as "mvn compile") consists only compiler:compile goal (plugin). 
Running a phase basically runs the plugins bound with it.

- Build Lifecycle: 

A group of ordered phases. There are three built-in lifecycle: default, clean and site. 

- Maven Plugin 

A Maven plugin is a group of goals
```
<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <artifactId>maven-xxx-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>${maven.xxx.version}</version>
            <executions>
                <execution>
                    <goals>
                        <goal>goal1</goal>
                        <goal>goal2</goal>
                    </goals>
                    <phase>validate</phase>
                </execution>
            </executions>
            <configuration>
            </configuration>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
```

## mvn command
```
mvn <PHASE>
mvn <PHASE>:<GOAL>
mvn <PLUGIN>:<GOAL>
```

## Life Cycle
There are three built-in life cycles. [ @see the attached Phases ](http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-lifecycle.html#Lifecycle%5FReference):

- default: the main life cycle as it's responsible for project deployment
- clean: to clean the project and remove all files generated by the previous build
- site: to create the project's site documentation
