## Absolute Radio-Frequency Channel Number (ARFCN) 
ARFCN is a code that specifies a pair of reference frequencies used for transmission and reception in radio system. 
In a FDD system one ARFCN number is required for downlink and another for uplink  as downlink and uplink frequencies
are different while for TDD system only one ARFCN number is enough as downlink and uplink frequency remains same.
- ARFCN started from GSM 
- UARFCN for UMTS/WCDMA: 25.101-1 and 25.101-2 
- EARFCN for E-UTAR/LTE: 36.101-1 and 36.101-2
- NR-ARFCN for 5G/New Radio: NR-ARFCNs for 5G new radio are defined in 3GPP specification 38.101-1 and 38.101-2.
