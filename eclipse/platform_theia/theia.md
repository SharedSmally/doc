# Eclipse THEIA: https://theia-ide.org/
Eclipse THEIA is an Open, Flexible and Extensible Cloud & Desktop IDE Platform.

Theia is designed to work as a native desktop application as well as in the context of a browser and a remote server. To support both situations with a single source, Theia runs in two separate processes. Those processes are called frontend and backend respectively, and they communicate through JSON-RPC messages over WebSockets or REST APIs over HTTP. In the case of Electron, the backend, as well as the frontend, run locally, while in a remote context the backend would run on a remote host.

Both the frontend and backend processes have their dependency injection (DI) container (see below) to which extensions can contribute.
