### [Comparison] (https://www.guru99.com/react-vs-angular-key-difference.html)
  - Data binding:
   	React language uses one-way data binding, which means that the Ul elements can’t be changed without updating the corresponding model state. 	Angular, on the other hand, uses the two-way data binding method. It helps you to ensure that the model state automatically changes when any change is made.
    
  - Model
   	Reactjs is based on Virtual DOM using JSX/JavaScript XML, while Angular is based on MVC (Model View Controller) based on TypeScript
    
### Angular
Angular is a development platform built on the typescript. It is a component-based framework for building scalable web apps. 
It has a collection of well-integrated libraries and features such as client-server communication, routing, and more. It has 
a suite of developer tools to develop and scale projects from single-developer size to enterprise-grade applications.

### React
React is an open-source JavaScript library used for frontend development. It is used for building user interface or UI components.
Its component-based and declarative traits let developers create interactive and complex UIs easily. Developers can build fast 
and scalable apps for all platforms due to its “learn once write anywhere” principle.
