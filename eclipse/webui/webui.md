### Angular
Angular is a development platform built on the typescript. It is a component-based framework for building scalable web apps. 
It has a collection of well-integrated libraries and features such as client-server communication, routing, and more. It has 
a suite of developer tools to develop and scale projects from single-developer size to enterprise-grade applications.

### React
React is an open-source JavaScript library used for frontend development. It is used for building user interface or UI components.

and scalable apps for all platforms due to its “learn once write anywhere” principle.
