## [Inventory](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_inventory.html)
Ansible works against multiple systems in your infrastructure at the same time. It does this by selecting portions of systems listed in Ansibleâ€™s inventory, which defaults to being saved in the location */etc/ansible/hosts*. You can specify a different inventory file using the *-i <path>* option on the command line.

- Hosts:  
In INI:
```
jumper ansible_port=5555 ansible_host=192.0.2.50
```
In YAML:
```
...
  hosts:
    jumper:
      ansible_port: 5555
      ansible_host: 192.0.2.50
```
