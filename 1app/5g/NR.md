- **Access Network(NG-RAN)**: consists of a set of gNBs connected to 5GC via NG interface. A gNB can support FDD, TDD or dual mode operation. 
gNBs can be interneccted through Xn interface. A gNB may consist of a gNB-CU and one or more gNB-DU(s). a gNB-CU and gNB-DU is connected via F1 interface.
     - 
- **Core Network (5GC)**: Service-based network provides distributed cloud, NFV(network function virtualization) and SDN(Software Defined Networking)
     - 3GPP TS 29.500,501;
