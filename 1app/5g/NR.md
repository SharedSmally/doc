- **Access Network(NG-RAN)**: consists of a set of gNBs connected to 5GC via NG interface. A gNB can support FDD, TDD or dual mode operation. 
gNBs can be interneccted through Xn interface. A gNB may consist of a gNB-CU and one or more gNB-DU(s). a gNB-CU and gNB-DU is connected via F1 interface.
     
- **Core Network (5GC)**: Service-based network provides distributed cloud, NFV(network function virtualization) and SDN(Software Defined Networking)

## 3GPP protocols for mobile telecommunications
- GSM and related 2G and 2.5G standards, including GPRS and EDGE
- UMTS and related 3G standards, including HSPA and HSPA+
- LTE and related 4G standards, including LTE Advanced and LTE Advanced Pro
- 5G NR and related 5G standards, including 5G-Advanced
