## Docker Image
```
FROM busybox
ENV FOO=/bar
WORKDIR ${FOO}   # WORKDIR /bar
ADD . $FOO       # ADD . /bar
COPY \$FOO /quux # COPY $FOO /quux

$ docker build -t succeeds --no-cache=true .
```
- FROM: FROM ImageName
```
      FROM [--platform=<platform>] <image> [AS <name>]
      FROM [--platform=<platform>] <image>[:<tag>] [AS <name>]
      FROM [--platform=<platform>] <image>[@<digest>] [AS <name>]
```      
- RUN
```
    RUN <command> (shell form, the command is run in a shell,/bin/sh -c on Linux or cmd /S /C on Windows)
    RUN ["executable", "param1", "param2"] (exec form)
    RUN --mount=[type=<TYPE>][,option=<value>[,option=<value>]...]
```
- CMD: only one CMD in one docker file,  provide defaults for an executing container.
```
    CMD ["executable","param1","param2"] (exec form, the preferred form)
    CMD ["param1","param2"] (as default parameters to ENTRYPOINT)
    CMD command param1 param2 (shell form)
```
- LABEL:  LABEL <key>=<value> <key>=<value> <key>=<value> ...
- EXPOSE: EXPOSE <port> [<port>/<protocol>...]
- ENV:  ENV <key>=<value> ...     #ENV abc=bye def=$abc
     - ${variable_name};
     - ${variable:-word}: If not set, word is the result.
     - ${variable:+word}: If set, word is the result, otherwise is the empty string.
- ADD:  copies new files, directories or remote file URLs, accept *, ? 
```
   ADD [--chown=<user>:<group>] [--checksum=<checksum>] <src>... <dest>
   ADD [--chown=<user>:<group>] ["<src>",... "<dest>"]
   ADD [--keep-git-dir=<boolean>] <git ref> <dir>      
```      
- COPY
```
   COPY [--chown=<user>:<group>] <src>... <dest>
   COPY [--chown=<user>:<group>] ["<src>",... "<dest>"]
```
- ENTRYPOINT:  configure a container that will run as an executable.
```
  ENTRYPOINT ["executable", "param1", "param2"]
  ENTRYPOINT command param1 param2
```      
- VOLUME:  VOLUME ["/data"]
- USER:  USER <user>[:<group>]/<UID>[:<GID>]
- WORKDIR: WORKDIR /path/to/workdir  # dir for RUN, CMD, ENTRYPOINT, COPY and ADD
- ARG:  ARG <name>[=<default value>] # variable passed at build-time using --build-arg <varname>=<value> flag
     - Predefined ARGs: HTTP_PROXY/ http_proxy/HTTPS_PROXY/https_proxy/FTP_PROXY/ftp_proxy/NO_PROXY/no_proxy/ALL_PROXY/all_proxy
     - Automatic platform ARGs: TARGETPLATFORM/TARGETOS/TARGETARCH/TARGETVARIANT; BUILDPLATFORM/BUILDOS/BUILDARCH/BUILDVARIANT    
- ONBUILD:  ONBUILD <INSTRUCTION>  #trigger instruction
- STOPSIGNAL: STOPSIGNAL signal    #system signal that will be sent to the container to exit.
- HEALTHCHECK
```      
   HEALTHCHECK [OPTIONS] CMD command (check container health by running a command inside the container)
   HEALTHCHECK NONE (disable any healthcheck inherited from the base image      
  OPTIONS:
    --interval=DURATION (default: 30s)
    --timeout=DURATION (default: 30s)
    --start-period=DURATION (default: 0s)
    --retries=N (default: 3)      
```      
- SHELL: SHELL ["executable", "parameters"]  # default shell used for the shell form of commands 

### ADD vs COPY
- COPY takes in a source and destination. It only copy in a local or directory from the host (the machine-building the Docker image) into the Docker image itself.
- ADD  does that same but in addition, it also supports 2 other sources. 
     - A URL instead of a local file/directory.
     - Extract tar from the source directory into the destination.    

### RUN vs CMD vs ENTRYPOINT
- RUN: executes commands and creates new image layers.
- CMD: sets the command and its parameters to be executed by default after the container is started. it can be replaced by docker run command line parameters. 
- ENTRYPOINT: configures the command to run when the container starts, Sets default parameters that cannot be overridden while executing Docker containers with CLI parameters.
- SHELL: set the shell command used by the shell form of commands 
When both CMD and ENTRYPOINT are used, the executable is defined with ENTRYPOINT, while CMD specifies the default parameter.
```
FROM ubuntu
ENTRYPOINT ["echo", "Hello"]
CMD ["Abhinav"]      
      
docker build -t entrypoint-cmd .
docker run entrypoint-cmd   => Hello Abhinav
docker run entrypoint-cmd @abhinavd26 =>    Hello @abhinavd26 
      
```
