## Docker
Both Docker *run* and *exec* execute commands in a Docker container.

## run
Use this to run a command in a new container. It is used when there is no container running, 
and need to create one, start it and then run a process on it.
```
docker run [OPTIONS] IMAGE [COMMAND] [ARG...]
docker run --name ubuntu_bash --rm -i -t ubuntu bash
```
Some options:
- _ --name_ assigns a name to the container, in this case ubuntu_bash
- _ --rm _ like the bash command rm it removes the container, but when it exits
- _ -i _ short for -interactive, this ensures STDIN is kept open even if not attached to the running container
- _ -t _, which can also be referenced with -tty , starts an interactive bash shell in the container
- The image for the container follows the options, here it is the image ubuntu
- The last part that follows the image, is the command you want to run: bash

## exec
This is used to run a command in an existing container. There already has a container running 
and want to change it or obtain something from it:
```
docker exec [OPTIONS] CONTAINER COMMAND [ARG...]
docker exec -d -w /temp ubuntu_bash touch my_file.sh
```
- -w followed by the directory or file path allows you to state which working directory you want to run the command in.
- -d or -detached means that the container will run in detached mode, so you can still continue to use your terminal session with the container running in the background. Donâ€™t use this if you want to see what the container sends to STDOUT.
- The command is touch used to create the file with the name my_file.sh inside the /temp directory of the running container ubuntu_bash
